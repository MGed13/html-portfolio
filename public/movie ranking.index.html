<h1>The Best Movies According To Murray</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Inglorious Bastards</h3>
<p>
  Such a great movie from start to finish. Some fantastic acting from the cast
  and can watch over and over again.
</p>
<h3>He-Man Masters Of The Universe</h3>
<p>
  My favourite movie growing up. Used to watch this with my older sister and
  know the script word for word. Classic cheesy acting however it has to go down
  as my top 3 movies of all time.
</p>
<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>
  Favourite Christmas movie of all time and can watch this without it being
  Christmas. Classic favourite and also another movie I know the script word for
  word.
